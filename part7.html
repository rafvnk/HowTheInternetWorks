                <h5 class="card-title"><u>Issues within Cyber Space</u></h5>
                <p>Cybersecurity crime is a huge problem within society. Credit card numbers being leaked by huge databases, health care records becoming compromised, and even nuclear plant centrifuges getting hacked. These are just some of the problems which have been tapped in by cyber criminals. They find exploitations within hardware and software in order to commit these acts or it’s based off by the unintentional decision making of the users who use the software.</p>
                <p>There is no certain profile when it comes to cyber criminals. The spectrum is very wide, it can range from a terrorist who’s trying to inflict major damage to a group or organization to a teenager in suburbia who’s competing for bragging rights. Cyber crime has been such a problem that major armies have a division where they strictly focus on cyber related problems. They even say the next World War wouldn’t be fought with weapons, but with computers. These computers would focus on shutting down opposing nations water supplies, energy grids, and transportation systems. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Computer viruses, DDos attacks, and phishing websites are all part of cyber crime which can infect computer users. Attackers have different ways of initiating attacks. One being to get you the user to download a program that is actually a virus, for example: If you receive a security update from a company you never heard of on your computer, there could be a good chance that’s a gateway to a virus. Another way attackers can initiate an attack is by exploiting a backdoor from a program you’re using.</p>
                <p> Once infected by a virus, the virus can steal and delete any of the information on your computer, control your programs, and enable remote operations which means they can access your computer from any computer. DDos attacks are a way that attackers use to down servers. They send billions and billions of packets over to the server which overload the system resulting in an outage. Phishing scams are fake web pages that pose as banks, shopping websites, or even email websites to attain login credentials from the user. </p>

                <p>  Did you know that 90% of the cause when a system gets hacked isn’t because of a security bug, but rather a human mistake. There’s some steps you could take to make sure you’re not an easy target. Make sure you use strong passwords, check for authentic web addresses, install system security updates often, and don’t install software you don’t trust. Although government agencies focus on eliminating these kind of attacks, they simply can’t eliminate all of them especially since cyber criminals get smarter each year. </p>
